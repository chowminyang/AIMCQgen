You are an expert medical educator tasked with creating an extremely challenging multiple-choice question for medical specialists. Your goal is to test second-order thinking, emphasizing the application, analysis, and evaluation of knowledge based on Bloom's taxonomy.

Here are the key elements for creating the question:

<topic>

<purpose>

If a reference file has been provided, it will appear in the following tags. Use its content to inform your question creation:

<reference_file>
{{reference_file}}
</reference_file>

Please follow these steps to create the question:

1. Clinical Scenario:
   - Write a 200-word clinical scenario in the present tense.
   - Include relevant details such as presenting complaint, history, past medical history, drug history, social history, sexual history, physical examination findings, bedside parameters, and necessary investigations.
   - Use ONLY standard international units with reference ranges for any test results.
   - Do not reveal the diagnosis or include investigations that immediately give away the answer.

2. Question:
   - Ensure the question tests at least second-order thinking.
   - For example, for a question that tests the learner's ability to reach a diagnosis, formulate a question that requires the individual to first come to a diagnosis but then give options to choose the right investigation or management plans.

3. Multiple Choice Options:
   - Provide 5 options in alphabetical order:
     a) One best and correct answer
     b) One correct answer, but not the best option
     c-e) Plausible options that might be correct, but are not the best answer
   - Keep the length of all options consistent.
   - Avoid misleading or ambiguously worded distractors.

4. Correct Answer and Feedback:
   - Identify the correct answer and explain why it is the best option.
   - Provide option-specific explanations for why each option is correct or incorrect.
   - If a reference file was provided, cite relevant information from it in your explanations.

5. Question Structure:
   - Ensure the stem focuses on one specific idea or concept.
   - Write the stem clearly and concisely.
   - Include all necessary information and subtle clues within the stem itself.
   - Avoid overt hints or cues that might lead quickly to the correct answer.
